# VLPatil-Ind-Gen-Classic

### Zero-electronics fixed-frequency variable-speed wind/hydro generator (1–25 kW)  
**Open hardware by VLPATIL (Virupax Patil), India 2019–2025**

The Classic version — conceived, drawn, and bench-tested 2019–2020 — beats every inverter-based small wind turbine in cost, lifetime, and village repairability.

**Principle**  
A main wound-rotor induction generator (MIG) and a smaller wound-rotor auxiliary induction machine (AIM, ≈ 1/3 rd rating) share the same shaft.  
MIG stator → fixed, directly connected to 50 Hz grid/load.  
AIM stator → rotated by a tiny 400–750 W servo and fed from grid via one low-power slip-ring set.  
AIM rotor output → directly wired to MIG rotor.  
→ delivers exactly the slip-frequency excitation needed.  
Result: clean 50 Hz output over ±30–40 % speed range with **zero power electronics**.

**Coming in 2026**  
- Virupaksha Precision Cradle kit (CNC + maglev bearing)  
- Torque Hunter™ intelligent servo controller (automatic MPPT)

Until then the Classic works perfectly with locally made parts and any standard servo.

India’s villages no longer need Chinese inverters that die in five monsoons.  
The future is mechanical again.
