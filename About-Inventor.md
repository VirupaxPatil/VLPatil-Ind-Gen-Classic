### About the Inventor

My name is **Virupax Patil** (friends call me VLP).  
I am an electrical engineer graduated from Karnataka Regional Engineering College (KREC), now NITK Surathkal, Karnataka (India)

In 2019–2020 I conceived, drew, and bench-tested this zero-electronics variable-speed induction generator in my small home lab, because I was tired of watching ₹5-lakh Chinese inverters die in five monsoons while village pumps and homes stayed dark.

The design was filed as a patent application, then deliberately abandoned so it could never be locked away.  
Today, 29 November 2025, I am releasing the complete Classic version as open hardware so any farmer, mechanic, or defence post can build it tomorrow.

Everything here is yours to copy, improve, and sell.  
Just keep my name on it and release your changes the same way.

Thank you for helping bring reliable, repairable power to the last mile.
